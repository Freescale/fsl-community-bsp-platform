Freescale's Community Yocto BSP
===============================

To get the BSP you need to have `repo` installed and use it as:

Install the `repo` utility:

$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Download the BSP source:

$: PATH=${PATH}:~/bin
$: mkdir fsl-community-bsp
$: cd fsl-community-bsp
$: repo init -u https://github.com/Freescale/fsl-community-bsp-platform -b dora
$: repo sync

Once this has complete, you will have all you need. To start a build, do:

$: source ./setup-environment build
$: bitbake core-image-minimal

You can use any directory to host your build.

The source code will be checked out at fsl-community-bsp/sources.

When creating patches, please use something like:

git format-patch -s --subject-prefix='fsl-community-bsp-platform][PATCH' origin

When sending patches, please use something like:

git send-email --to meta-freescale@yoctoproject.org <generated patch>

Using Development and Testing Branches
--------------------------------------

Replace the 'repo init' command above with one of the following:

master: for developers

$: repo init -u https://github.com/Freescale/fsl-community-bsp-platform -b master

master-next: for intrepid developers and testers

Patches are typically merged into master-next and then are merged into
master after a testing and comment period. It's possible that master-next
has something you want or need. But it's also possible that using
master-next will break something that was working before. Use with caution.

$: repo init -u https://github.com/Freescale/fsl-community-bsp-platform -b master-next
